# Conceptual TODO

- "movie + book" concept
  * how to handle both realms, merge into one efficient usable one
    - narrative as subtitles
    - each day as a chapter
  * table of contents? glossary?
  * balance text, visual clips, data
  * cohesive
- make replicable (so others can reproduce their projects)
  * tutorial?
  * additional system for user input
    - measurable data
    - journal entries
    - video footage
