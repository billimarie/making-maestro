# Conceptual TODO

- "movie + book" concept
  * how to handle both realms, merge into one efficient usable one
    - narrative as subtitles
    - each day as a chapter
  * table of contents? glossary?
  * balance text, visual clips, data
  * cohesive
- make replicable (so others can reproduce their projects)
  * tutorial?
  * additional system for user input
    - measurable data
    - journal entries
    - video footage

### Structure

- "twinkle twinkle little star" compilation / loop = pre-loader splash (8 seconds)
- 

- guiding the user through the narrative
  * navigational system comes into play after the video has already started (ie: non-intrusive)
- JS algorithm to determine main narrative highlights vs. curated (filter?)

- "unfolding quietly"
- one full screen (no scrolling)
  * separated elements for the graph, thumbnails, etc. (?)
  *
